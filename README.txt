Inventaria is a little project to manage the inventory of school's education departments.

It make use of advanced web technology, ajax, jquery, jquery-ui, mysql and web presentation with CSS.

I think that It is a good example of this kind of applications and It should be the basis of a bigger project.

Enjoy it!
